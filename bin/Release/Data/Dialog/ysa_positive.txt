U:It's ok to be scared, you know...
[angry]Y:I - I'm not scared. Not at all! Why should I be scared?
[normal]I mean it's probably only a matter of time 
before the humans come again 
[sad]and if not I will surely just dry out 
and die and look like frog-shaped resin and...
And how do you even know that I'm scared?
U:You seem to cloak your fear with talking philosophically. 
But it's alright I get you, you know.
Y:Do you?
U: You're afraid. 
You feel like you can't protect yourself. 
So your philosophy becomes your shield.
Y:It is the only thing I'm extraordinary in after all...
*sobbing*
U:Shh calm down, it's gonna be alright.
Y:N-n-no it's not. I will die here alone in this terrible cave.
U:You don't have to.
Y:Well, what am I supposed to do?
[2 choices]
You could be my girlfriend.
{
	Y:I-I could?
	U:If you want to that is. 
	I'd totally get if you wouldn't though. 
	I probably wouldn't either.
	[love]Y:No, no, I totally want to. 
	Have you ever realized how dysfunctional a queen is without a king?
	U:Err...no. But you're totally right!
	Y:Yep!
	U:...
	Y:...
	U:Soo, I will come back and get you when my heroic quest is done. 
	If that's ok with you.
	Y:Of course, it's totally ok with me.
	...as long as you really come back.
	U:Promise!
	Y:Then I'll wait for you, Tarkus. Stay safe!
	U:Bye! 
	If something scares you again, 
	you just have to cry out again and I'll come as fast as I can.
}
Go back to Deep Below and learn how to fight.
{
	[normal]Y:Do you really think I could do it?
	U:Definitely! 
	I mean look at your teeth.
	And I'm sure you have some other useful tricks up your sleeve.
	Y:Sleeve?
	U:Eeeh I mean up your slimy skin on your arm...
	But you can do it! I believe in you!
	Y:Hmmm...
	I'd be happier there, that's for sure...
	I'll do it!
	I will go back home and live my life.
	I won't be afraid anymore.
	Thank you Tarkus!
	U:Helping is what I'm here for.
	I hope we'll meet again sometime.
	Y:Yeah, you could come visit me in down below.
	I'll be off now. Take care!
	U:Bye!
	(That was quick.)
