[surprise]Y:Aaaaaaah!
[normal]Oh, it's just you...
Do you always sneak up on unsuspecting monsters like this?
U:Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Y:Soo - how is the 'disposing' coming along?
U:Uhmmm...
[2 choices]
...I haven't done it yet.
{
	Y:I guess that's fine too.
	You really shouldn't worry about me.
	U:I will...
	[2 choices]
	...definitely kill it, just not yet.
	{
	Y:Shouldn't you be going then?
	U:I'll be on my way.
	Y:Please be gentle while killing it! 
	I'd hate being the reason for even more pain...
	U:Will do.
	[break]
	}
	...not kill it.
	{
	Y:Oh. 
	Okay. 
	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you didn't follow through with it.
	It is a monster's life after all.
	U:I'm really sorry.
	I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
	Y:Don't sweat it.
	That would be just horrible for your fur.
	U:Eeeh...sure.

}
...I think I'd rather kill you. You'll make a great sacrifice.
