L:I say this very reluctantly, but you are a good guy. [blush]
Thank you for your help today, Tark. [happy]
T:Sure. Always glad to help.
If you need anything, just cry very loud, ok?
I have good ears, you know?
L:Okay.
Thanks for listening to me today.
I know I can be quite difficult sometimes.
T:(Sometimes, eh?)
Sure.
Well I gotta go now.
Help others in need.
Go easy on those poor souls!
L:Hehe... [blush]
No. [happy]
Bye Tark!
