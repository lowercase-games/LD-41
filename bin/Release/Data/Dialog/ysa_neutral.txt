U:I gotta be going now. 
It was nice talking to you.
(Not that I did much talking.)
Y:Uh yeah sure.
I always like to share my wisdom with...
less gifted monsters.
Your welcome!
U:Thanks.
I guess.
Y:Hope to see you around again.
Not many wander off here.
It gets pretty lonely.
U:If it gets too much to bear,
or you get scared again
you can just scream and I will come.
We furries have pretty good ears, you know.
Y:Oh that's neat. I'll do that.
Bye!
