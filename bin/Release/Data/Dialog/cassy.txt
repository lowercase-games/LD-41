I'm such a clutz uhwa~ [sad]

	I'm just a fan of cosmic horror. 
	C:For real?! [happy]
	Me too!
	T:But you... are...

Sorry, but I think your name sounds a bit like 'Thot'.
{
	C:T- [sad]
	Thot?
	Wha- what.. why are you...
	Uwaaaaaaahaha!
	T:(Probably shouldn't have said that)
	C:You're such a meany! [-1]
	T:Sorry about that.
}
T:So... anyway.
You called for help, is that correct? 
C:*sniff* Yeah. [sad]
Those stupid cultists beckoned me into this world...
Into this inferior form.
T:
[2 choices]
Yeah, that's an inferior form if I ever saw one.
{
	C:You don't need to beat a dead horse! *sob* [-1] [sad]
}
I think it's cute!
{
	C:You think so? [blush]
	Well... maybe it's not too bad after all. [+1]
	B-but I'm lacking 62 tentacles and 11 eyes... [sad]
	T:(Is that what they call over-sharing?)
}
C:But that's not all *sniff sob* [sad]
They are also binding me to this place with that cursed artefact.
I can't even move away from here, let alone fight back against them...
By the crawling chaos, such heresy shall not go unpunished! [angry]
I will infiltrate their minds,
Make them see their precious family being torn apart by Shoggoths,
With all their insides on the outside for all the world to see.
WHAT GOOD IS YOUR RITUAL NOW?!?
*Unintelligible tentacle sounds*
T:(That uhm... Is a proper tantrum alright.)
[2 choices]
I can help you! Is there anything you would like me to do about it?
{
	C:Oh, really? [happy]
	I'm so happy!
	T:(I can't believe her mood changed so quickly
	Almost like...)
	[2 choices]
	The currents of R'lyeh!
	{
		C:Wah?! [normal]
		W-where did that come from?
		Hearing that name makes me sad... [sad]
		To think that my kin is trapped down there.
		*sob* While I... While I...
		T:
		[3 choices]
		Tough shit, fam.
		{
			C:Why are you so mean? [-1] [sad]
			I thought you wanted to help me.
			*sniffle*
			T:*sigh* Yeah I do.
		}
		They will break free eventually! I know it!
		{
			C:You think so? [+1] 
			Th-thanks!
			You're right. [normal]
			I'm sure they will! [happy]
		}
		...
		{
			C:*sob sob* [sad]
			T:...
			C:*sniffle*
			just have to stay strong...
			For them... [normal]
		}
	}
	A child!
	{
	C:Awo~ [blush]
	Where? Where?
	I love children!
	T:(Yeah, I totally wasn't talking about you...
	Or maybe I was... >:D)
	I didn't think you would.
	C:Why shouldn't I? [normal]
	Their tentacles are so tiny and slimy!
	They're... So CUTE! <3 [blush]
	T:(What was I thinking?
	No, honestly... What did I expect?
	Time to rethink life.)
	There are none around here, sorry. Just wanted to hear your opinion.
	C: Aww... Getting my hopes up like that. [normal]
	}
	T:Okay, sorry about that. [normal]
	But what about the cultists?
	C:Yeah well, it's quite simple.
	For you at least... [sad]
	Because I'm still trapped here.
	Kill them and take the artefact. [angry]
	AH! [normal]
	T:Wha-
	C:AHHH!
	T:What is it?
	C:I completely forgot to mention.
	There is a deep-one lurking around here.
	I can smell her fishy breath from somewhere around here.
	I'd love to eat something, I'm literally starving. [happy]
	Awoooo~ You hear that sound? [play:stomach_growl]
	That's my empty stomach...
	I'm so weak. [sad]
	T:(I'm pretty sure that wasn't her stomach.)
	C:I really hate those fish-peoples guts. [normal]
	But the rest of them is quite delicious.
	Could you do this for me?
	It would really make me super happy! [happy]
	T:
	[3 choices]
	Uhm... I'll think about it. Let me kill the cultists first.
	{
		C:Yay!
		Thank you.
		Tell me if you are done.
		And when the grounds are soaked in sanguine reds,
		The Great-One shall return to her realm,
		A kind Manticore shall be blessed with the gift of the stars.
		T:Poetic.
		C:Thank you Tarkus.
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
	I will set you free. But I won't kill her.
	{
		C:Like in maybe not? [normal]
		T:More like in absolutely not.
		C:O-okay. [sad]
		T:Like I said, I will take on the cultists.
		C:Take on meeeeeee! [happy]
		Take me ooooooon!
		I'll be gone!
		In a day or twooooo!
		T:...
		(I expected her to get mad)
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
	Sure. Let the bodies hit the floor.
	{
		C:Yay, you are the best. [blush]
		Tell me if you are done. [happy]
		And when the grounds are soaked in sanguine reds,
		The Great-One shall return to her realm,
		A kind Manticore shall be blessed with the gift of the stars.
		T:Poetic.
		C:Thank you Tarkus.
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
}
I really can't be bothered right now.
{
	C:Oh please, please! [sad]
	Pretty please?
	T:No.
	C:Aw...
	Bummer.
	Please let me know if you changed your mind.
