(Why... is he not saying anything? [sad]
Did I... scream too loud...
Or maybe... he doesn't like me...
Figures... What did I think...
Someone like me...
A grotesque tentacle monster.)
T:
[2 choices]
Sure. I like you too.
{
	C:Yeah, figures, I mean, why would you, me being... me and stuff. [sad]
	With all those ten-
	Wait... did you...? [normal]
	T:I said yes. I really like you Cassy.
	C:You... like... me??? [happy]
	Ehhhhhhh~?! [blush]
	Uhm... ehehe.
	I didn't think you would... say that.
	So, I don't really know what to say now.
	T:Nothing would be fine.
	C:...
	...
	...
	No, I can't! [angry]
	I'm just too happy! [blush]
	May... I pet you?
	T:Sure. Be gentle. And mind the tail.
	C:Uwah~ So fluffy. [happy]
	Can I ask you something weird?
	T:Totally.
	C:Can you say *meow* or *nya~*
	T:
	[3 choices]
	Meow!
	{
		C:Awoooo~ [blush]

	}
	Nya!
	{
		C:Awoooo~ [blush]
		You are so cute, I could die.
		That is if I was physically able to. [happy]
	}

		Awoooo~	[blush]
		You are so cute, I could die.
		That is if I was physically able to. [happy]
	}
	C: I promised you the gift of the stars, didn't I? [blush]
	T:Yeah?
	C:*Kiss*
	T:(Her tentacles tickle...)
	I think, it was worth it...
	C:Ehehe~ [happy]
	Please keep my artefact.
	That way you can always summon me.
	And maybe I can help you then. [blush]
	Or... we cou-
	Could... do something else?
	T:Sure.
	C:I'm so happy I met you Tarkus the Manticore. [normal]
	Or... Tarky [happy]
	T:(It seems attatching a 'Y' to a name makes it automatically more cute.
	Or... DOES IT?)
	Sounds great.
	I promise you to beckon you whenever I feel lonely.
	I gotta go now.
	Help other monsters in need.
	C:Oh... ok. But you wouldn't romance them, would you? [sad]
	T:
	[2 choices]
	I only need you.
	{
		C:Ok. Thank you Tarky. [normal]
		Bye bye. [sad]
	}
	I... Uhm. I gotta go.
	{
		C:Ok... [normal]
		Bye bye. [sad]
	}
}
Uhhh... You really caught me off guard.
{
	T:Why don't we become friends?
	C:C:Yeah, figures, I mean, with me being... me and stuff. [sad]
	With all those ten-
	Wait... did you...? [normal]
	T:I said we really should become friends.
	I like you a bunch, Cassy.
	We would be great friends.
	C:You... want me... as a real friend? [blush]
	Ehhhhhhh~?!
	Uhm... ehehe. [normal]
	I didn't think you would... say that.
	Sure, I'd love to be friend with you. [blush]
	Play games... read books... [happy]
	Crush humans, physically and psychologically.
	You know... what friends do.
	T:(I'm not sure about the last part.)
	Yeah, cool.
	C:Cool... [normal]
	If I don't count my kin and the one dude that draws lewd art of me... [blush]
	You are my first friend! [happy]
	T:I, uhm, I'm happy.
	...
	Okay, welp, gotta go now, safe more monsters.
