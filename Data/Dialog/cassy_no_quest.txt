C:Hey Tark.
Changed your mind?
T:
[2 choices]
I did. Let's kick some ass!
{
	C:Yay! I'm so happy you hanged your mind. [happy]
	And AH!
	I completely forgot to mention.
	There is this deep-one lurking around here. [normal]
	I can smell her fishy breath from somewhere around here.
	I'd love to eat something, I'm literally starving. [happy]
	Awoooo~ You hear that sound? [play:stomach_growl]
	That's my empty stomach...
	I'm so weak. [sad]
	T:(I'm pretty sure that wasn't her stomach.)
	C:I really hate those fish-peoples guts. [normal]
	But the rest of them is quite delicious.
	Could you do this for me?
	It would really make me super happy! [happy]
	T:
	[3 choices]
	Uhm... I'll think about it. Let me kill the cultists first.
	{
		C:Yay!
		Thank you.
		Tell me if you are done.
		And when the grounds are soaked in sanguine reds,
		The Great-One shall return to her realm,
		A kind Manticore shall be blessed with the gift of the stars.
		T:Poetic.
		C:Thank you Tarkus.
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
	I will set you free. But I won't kill her.
	{
		C:Like in maybe not? [normal]
		T:More like in absolutely not.
		C:O-okay. [sad]
		T:Like I said, I will take on the cultists.
		C:Take on meeeeeee! [happy]
		Take me ooooooon!
		I'll be gone!
		I a day or twooooo!
		T:...
		(I expected her to get mad)
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
	Sure. Let the bodies hit the floor.
	{
		C:Yay, you are the best. [blush]
		Tell me if you are done. [happy]
		And when the grounds are soaked in sanguine reds,
		The Great-One shall return to her realm,
		A kind Manticore shall be blessed with the gift of the stars.
		T:Poetic.
		C:Thank you Tarkus.
		[trigger kill ysa quest]
	}
}
I absolutely don't want to do it.
{
	C:Fine! [angry]
	You... you Gnoph-Keh!
	No, even Gnoph-Kehs are less stupid than you!
	T:No you didn't...
	C:I-I'm sorry. [sad]
	T:(I have enough of this one.)
	[end quest]
