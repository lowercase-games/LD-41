T:Hey! You!
Why are you running?
K:Oh my... What a fluffy gentleman you are. [sad]
Helping a lady in distress?
I'm actually jumping, you know? [normal]
Running usually involves two legs. [sad]
T:(Why does it sound like she is talking down on me?)
[2 choices]
Yep, here to help.
{
	K:Well, that was about time. [normal]
	Do you know how long you kept me waiting? [angry]
	T:I uhh...
	K:It seems like you literally helped every other monster on this planet...
	Before you actually came to help me.
	But... a youngster like you shall be forgiven. [+1] [sad]
	And to be honest I'm in quite a pickle here.
	Those honorable sexy men are really chasing me. [blush]
	At first I enjoyed the attention...
	But now...
	I think I grew tired of them. [happy]
	*Sigh*
	Men really can't handle their sex-drive [blush]
	T:(She said the word...
	This game was supposed to be child-friendly.)
	I, uh don't know if tha-
	K:What's with you and your 'uh's?  [happy]
	Can't handle the sight of a strong independant Kasa-Obake?
	T:Uh...
	K:Well that is to expected. 
	I know, I can be quite overwhelming with my charm. [blush]
	T:
	[2 choices]
	I agree. Your charm really is... overwhelming.
	{
		K:Isn't it though? [happy]
		You too... are not lacking in charm I see. [+1] [blush]
		Only in age. [happy]
		T:But I'm at least uhm fou-
		K:No more 'uhm's, 'uh's or 'no's sweetheart.
		From now on I only expect to hear 'Yes Ma'am'. [angry]
		T:(I didn't even say 'no' a single time.)
		[2 choices]
		Yes Ma'am
		{
			K:Good boy. [+1] [blush]
		}
		No Ma'am
		{
			K:Such a... [normal]
			Disobedient child. [-1] [angry]
		}
	}
	You certainly are overwhelming. Your 'charm' is not. 
	{
		K:Excuse me? [angry]
		Has your mother not tought you how to behave when a lady is present?
		T:No. She tought me how to hunt.
		How to kill and run.
		K:Whatever. [-1]
	}
}
I don't think I have to help you. 
{
	K:You are wrong. [angry]
	I think you are missing out on something. [blush]
	T:Yeah?
	K:Yep. [sad]
	T:If that's the case...
	[2 choices]
	I will help you. What happened?
	{
