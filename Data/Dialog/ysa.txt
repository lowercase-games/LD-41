[surprise]Y:Aaaaaaah! 
Please don't eat me! I'm not tasty at all!
[3 choices]
Oh, don't worry. I never liked fish anyways so you're totally safe from me.
{
	[angry]Y:Come on now, you do realize I'm not a fish? 
	Do I have gills? No I don't.
	(Oh crap, I shouldn't have said that. 
	Now he's definitely going to eat me. 
	I should enlighten him with some of my amphibious philosophy, 
	he seems to really need it and maybe that'll safe me from being eaten...)
	Have you ever asked yourself whether gills make unintelligent 
	or rather that all unintelligent things have gills? 
	I mean we need to ask the serious questions here and while I think that.....
	U:(She sure talks a lot. And so fast. 
	I don't even know whether she's just making fish sounds or still talking. 
	I should probably introduce myself.)
	[-1]
}
No, you don't have to be afraid of me. I would never eat someone as cute as you.
{
	[love]Y:Uhhh, thank you.
	Sooo - who are you and what brings you here?
	[+1]
}
Well I won't eat you, but I bet Cassy would be really happy about you as a sacrifice.

[normal]U:My name is Tarkus. Tarkus the manticore. 
And I made it my mission to help monsters in distress. 
I heard someone screaming around here. 
Figured I'd take a look to make sure everything's alright.
Y:That must have been when I thought I saw one of those humans. 
They are always trying to kill me, 
talking about how much 'experience' they'll gain.
I'm Eg'yshal by the way.
You probably can't pronounce that correctly so just call me Ysa.
U:Are you ok now? Should I kill some humans for you?
Y:Oh no, it's fine. I only imagined it anyway.
Back home in Deep Below they were always coming in through holes in the ceiling...
but since I moved to this forgotten place it's been far quieter. 
Mostly.
U:I wonder...

...if you miss Deep Below.
{
	[sad]Y:Oh yes, terribly.
	The dry air here is disastrous for my skin. 
	Like my skin care routine before literally didn't exist - 
	and now I need three different serums, five moisturizers and a cave-dust-blocker.
	U:(I'm not quite sure what she's talking about...)
	[normal]Y:People say that amphibious creatures are naturally slimy. 
	I urge you to ask yourself 'Have they ever touched one?' 
	Think about it.
	U: Uhmm...
	Y:So really it all boils down to how monstery you want to feel 
	vs. how monstery they make you feel you have to feel.
	U:(What? What has that to do with anything? 
	And who are these ominous 'they'?)
	Y:What do you think?
	[2 choices]
	I didn't understand a word from what you just said.
	{
		[angry]Y:I should have known you wouldn't understand me. 
		The thoughts of Furries like you will never be as deep as mine.
		[-1]
	}
	That was the most philosophical thing I ever heard.
	{
		[love]Y:I'm so glad you can appreciate it. 
		I feel like I can't connect with most monsters 
		because I'm in such an elevated state of mind when it comes to philosophy.
		U:Oh I hear you, I hear you.
		(Technically that's not even a lie.)
		[+2]

	[end]
}
...if there is something else I could do for you.
{
	[sad]Y:There is this tentacle thing that wants to eat me...
	[2 choices]
	I will...dispose of it for you.
	{
		[surprise]Y:That means killing it, doesn't it?
		U:Well... Yes.
		[normal]Y:I guess I could finally sleep then.
		But I'm not sure if my sleep is worth another monster's life...
		U:Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.
		Y:Uh-okay, I guess.

	That tentacle thing would surely appreciate if I sacrificed you.
	{
		[kill]
	}
}
...if Cassy would approve of you as a sacrifice.
