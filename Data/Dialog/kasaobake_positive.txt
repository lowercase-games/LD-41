	K:Smash and dash? [blush]
	T:Wam bam thank you ma'am?
	K:Ejaculate and evacuate?
	T:(Dear oh dear, she ain't mincing words.)
	Pounce and bounce?
	K:Pump and dump?
	T:Nail it and bail it?
	K:Shoot the jizz then out you is?
	T:Hump it then dump it?
	K:Tap that ass then hit the gas?

	Are you sure you are okay with an older lady like me?
	T:Stop saying you are old. I don't care.
	K:You are the most charming Lion I have ever met. [blush]

	But I bet you want to finish your adventure.

	K:Friends, huh? [angry]
	Well sure. [normal]
	Though I can't say that I didn't get my hopes up for a bit. [sad]
	T:(Activate dense protagonist mode.)
	Cool! I'm happy we are friends now.
	K:If you want something else from me, call 4419 5422 91 [blush]
	And type friendship+.
	T:I.. Uh...?
	... I mean, yes Ma'am.
