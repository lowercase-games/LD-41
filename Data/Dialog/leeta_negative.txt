L:You are a douche! [angry]
T:Wait woah.
Where did that come from?
L:Where?
Maybe the deepest parts of my tiny bird heart?
Because that's what you think I am, right? [sad]
T:Calm down, I never said that!
L:Yeah you didn't need to!
Idiot! [angry]
Meany!
Over-sized dumb cat-thing!
T:Hey!
The last one hurt...
L:Yeah?
Want me to console you?
Get lost.
T:Gladly!
