L:You know... [blush]
I'm really glad you ran into me today.
You are a good guy Tarkus...
And I like you a lot.
T:[2 choices]
I like you too, Leeta.
{
	L:Oh... I... [blush]
	You...
	Like me too?
	T:I...
	Think so.
	L:You...
	*Hmph* What is that supposed to mean, stupid? [sad]
	T:I mean I really do like you.
	L:Despite my... [blush]
	Attitude?
	T:Yep.
	(Though she certainly DOES have some temper)
	L:Oh.
	I... I'm glad. [happy]
	T:Me too.
	L:... [blush]
	T:...
	L:...
	This is very embarassing.
	T:I know.
	Maybe I should go now. 
	I can come back later.
	L:Ok...
	I'll wait for you Tarkus. [happy]
	One more thing though! [blush]
	T:Y-yeah?
	L:May I touch your fur?
	It looks super soft and fluffy. [happy]
	T:Sure.
	L:(So soft...) [blush]
}
Cool beans. How about we become friends?
{
	L:F-friends? [normal]
	Friends... [blush]
	Sure! [happy]
	You seem like a nice guy.
	And it's not like I 'like' like you or anything... [blush]
	That's a lot of likes, huh?
	Hehehe.
	T:So it's in the bag then?
	GAHAHA!
	L:Yes. [happy]
	But you have special duties now as my first friend.
	Like running errands and such.
	T:(Is that not what I already did?)
	Yeah, sure!
	L:It's a promise then.
	T:Promise.
	L:Thank you Tark.
	... Thank you. [blush]
	T:No need to thank me.
	Anyway, I gotta go now.
	If you need anything just scream very loudly.
	I have very good ears, you know?
	L:Okay.
	Bye.
