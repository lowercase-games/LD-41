Have you ever wondered how your (love) life would have played out had you been born a manticore?
Did you always want to have a harem full of cute and terrifying monsters?
Are you still wondering what's up with that Flamingo from our earlier games?
Us too! And now finally the answer to all these questions is here.

"Rose-Coloured Dungeon Life", a game that has you romancing monsters instead of killing them. (We mean that. No killing monsters neccessary.)
Instead you slaughter humans (they deserve it), get to know up to four unique partners (could it be there is a secret fifth one? naaaah.) and save the dungeon.
We know you love to be the knight in shining armor. (Though you may die some times. Use WaifuMode for more waifu and less shining.)
